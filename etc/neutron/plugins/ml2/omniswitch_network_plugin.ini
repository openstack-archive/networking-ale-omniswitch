# This section provides details about the OmniSwitch devices and other configuration options.

# OMNI_EDGE_DEVICES:
# The list of OmniSwitch edge devices. The format of the 'omni_edge_devices' is as follows:
# omni_edge_devices = <switch-ip>:<switch-type>:<user-name>:<password>:<command-prompt>:<access-method>:<compute-interfaces>:<core-interfaces>,
#                     <switch-ip>:<switch-type>:<user-name>:<password>:<command-prompt>:<access-method>:<compute-interfaces>:<core-interfaces>,
#                     ...
#                     ...
#                     <switch-ip>:<switch-type>:<user-name>:<password>:<command-prompt>:<access-method>:<compute-interfaces>:<core-interfaces>
#
# where,  'switch-ip' is the management ip address of the edge switch.
#         'switch-type' is the type of the switch; 
#                       possible values are: OS6900, OS10K, OS6850E, OS6855, OS6450, OS9000 or OS6860.
#         'user-name' is the user login for the switch.
#         'password' is the password credentials for the above user-name.
#         'command-prompt' is the command prompt string set for the switch.
#         'access-method' is the mechanism to be used to access the switch; 
#                         possible values are: REST or TELNET depending on device support.
#                         (Note: see SWITCH_ACCESS_METHOD for more.)
#         'compute-interfaces' are the interfaces on the edge switch connected to 'compute' nodes.
#         'core-interfaces' are the interfaces on the edge switch connected to the core switch of the network.
#
# Note: Device entries are separated by comma (,) and many devices may be added to the list.
#       Interfaces are separated by space (' ') and many interfaces may be added to the list.
#       Interfaces should be in the format corresponding to the platform used:
#			Possible values for OS6900 and OS10K: slot/port, chassis/slot/port or linkagg_id.
#             For example, 
#               1/2 if it is a standalone unit, represents slot/port
#             1/2/3 if it is a VC, represents chassis/slot/port
#                 1 if it is a linkagg, represents linkagg_id
#           Possible values for OS6850E, OS6855, OS9000 and OS6450: slot/port or linkagg_id.
#             For example,
#               1/2 represents slot/port
#                 1 if it is a linkagg, represents linkagg_id
#			Possible values for OS6860: chassis/slot/port or linkagg_id.
#             For example, 
#             1/2/3 if it is a standalone unit or VC, represents chassis/slot/port
#                 1 if it is a linkagg, represents linkagg_id
#
#       Each item in the entry is separated by colon (:).
#       For user-name, password and command-prompt the default values 'admin', 'switch', '->' will be
#       used if empty but still separated by colon (:).
#
# For example,
# omni_edge_devices =  10.255.222.10:OS6900:admin:switch:->:TELNET:1/1 1/2:1/20 1/21,
#                      10.255.222.10:OS6850E:jhonc:alcatel123:Campus-Edge1->:TELNET:1/1 1/2:1/20 1/21,
#                      10.255.222.10:OS10K: : : :REST:1/1 1/2:1/20 1/21
#omni_edge_devices = 10.255.222.10:OS6900: : : :TELNET:1/3:1/19,
#                    10.255.222.12:OS6900: : : :TELNET:1/2:1/20
omni_edge_devices = 10.255.222.10:OS6900: : : :TELNET::1/19,
                    10.255.222.12:OS6900: : : :TELNET:1/2:1/20

# OMNI_CORE_DEVICES:
# The list of OmniSwitch core devices. The format of the 'omni_core_devices' is as follows:
# omni_core_devices = <switch-ip>:<switch-type>:<user-name>:<password>:<command-prompt>:<access-method>:<interfaces>,
#                     <switch-ip>:<switch-type>:<user-name>:<password>:<command-prompt>:<access-method>:<interfaces>,
#                     ...
#                     ...
#                     <switch-ip>:<switch-type>:<user-name>:<password>:<command-prompt>:<access-method>:<interfaces>
#
# Note: The description and format of the individual items are same as edge devices except for 'interfaces'.
#       Here, 'interfaces' are the interfaces on the core switch connected to edge switches
#       and/or other core switches.
#
# For example,
# omni_core_devices = 10.255.222.20:OS10K:admin:switch:->:REST:1/20 1/21,
#                     10.255.222.30:OS6850E:jhonc:alcatel123:Campus-Edge1->:TELNET:1/20 1/21,
#                     10.255.222.40:OS9000: : : :REST:1/1 1/2
omni_core_devices = 10.255.222.11:OS6900: : : :TELNET:1/19 1/20

# DHCP_SERVER_INTERFACE:
# The edge switch's ip address and the interface connected to the network node of the OpenStack setup
# (the dhcp-server is running on the network node).
# The format of the 'dhcp_server_interface' is the same as a core device, but with only one entry.
# For example, 
# dhcp_server_interface = 10.255.222.20:OS10K:admin:switch:->:TELNET:1/20 1/21
dhcp_server_interface = 10.255.222.10:OS6900: : : :TELNET:1/3

# SWITCH_SAVE_CONFIG_INTERVAL:
# This is used to specify how often (in seconds) the config changes in the switches are to be saved.
# The valid range is 600 - 1800 seconds. If value is out of range, it will default to 600 seconds.
switch_save_config_interval = 600
